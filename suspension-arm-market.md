<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dependent Suspension</li><li>Independent Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suspension arm market can be classified into two main types: dependent suspension and independent suspension. Dependent suspension systems link the performance of wheels, causing them to move in unison, which can enhance stability but limit individual wheel response. In contrast, independent suspension allows each wheel to move independently, improving handling, ride comfort, and traction by adapting to varying road conditions. Both types are essential in automotive design, catering to different performance needs and driving experiences.</p></p>
