<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquefied Petroleum Gas Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Infrastructure Market comprises two primary types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals are facilities where LPG is produced by cooling natural gas to very low temperatures, converting it into a liquid form for easier storage and transportation. Regasification terminals, on the other hand, convert the liquefied gas back into its gaseous state for distribution and use in various applications. Together, these terminals enable efficient handling and supply of LPG in the energy market.</p></p>
